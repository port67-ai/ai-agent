# Central change log

Single ongoing ledger. Historical imported PRD section 26 is a baseline record only. Commit association: `git log -- docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

## CHG-0001 — 2026-11-11 — Shared repository memory
- Author/harness: Codex; requested by owner in this session.
- What: preserve supplied PRD and business plan; establish shared harness rules, status register, decisions, handover, documentation checks and PR template. Preserve previous CLAUDE guidance separately.
- Why: enable future coding sessions to continue from repository evidence without prior chat context.
- Requirements: FAC-DEV-001, FAC-DEV-002, FAC-DEV-003, FAC-DEV-004, FAC-DEV-005, FAC-DEV-006; governance support only, not verified Factory acceptance.
- PRD impact: none. Product requirements unchanged; imported PRD stays proposed 1.0.0. Central-ledger convention documented in GOVERNANCE.md.
- Evidence: `python3 scripts/check_docs_governance.py --base 26ab3be` and `git diff --check` (results recorded in HANDOVER.md).
- Status: prepared for commit on docs/port67-project-memory; merge, remote CI and deployment not claimed. Resolve exact commit through Git history.
- Runtime/deployment effects: none; no application source, infrastructure configuration or customer data changed.
